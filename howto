This is a basic CGI server named DE written in C lanuage. It is also hooked to Clisp. 
The Clisp side is for questions generation.

Assumption::
This app was only tested with gcc and clisp.

configuration
Go to bridge.c and make sure that your path point to where clisp is
execl("/usr/bin/clisp", "clisp", "./CAPTCHA/cd.lisp",NULL);
Go to serverd.c and adjust the port as you wish

compile and run::

gcc -o serverd serverd.c

./serverd

At DE server prompt enter start to run server, and to
stop the server enter stop.

Send message to the server using the below format. You can change the Port accordingly



To get question run the below
On another shell ,do the following:
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5566/question'
(change the port number to reflect what you have from the server)

The server will response with a question... simple mathematical expression(this is machine generated , so the gramma may be wrong)
example of math expression:- WHAT IS 196 / 431 ?

Solve the maths, and do the following:
Replace all the space in the math expression with "%20" before sending back to server.

curl -X PUT -d answer=67 -d question=WHAT%20IS%20196%20/%20431%20?
